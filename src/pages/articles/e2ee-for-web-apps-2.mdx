In the last article, we covered the mechanism of key derivation from a password. We also discovered the term **DEK** (Data Encryption Key). We have generated a DEK and a salt. What's next?

## Storing the salt

We have generated a DEK from the clear-text password of the user (through a key derivation function). We have also generated a salt. This means that if we want to regenerate the exact same DEK we need to store the salt on the backend.

Let's take a look at our previous `users` table:

```
  Column ............................... Type  
  id, autoincrement ................. integer  
  email ............................. varchar  
  email_verified_at, nullable ...... datetime  
  password .......................... varchar  
  remember_token, nullable .......... varchar  
  created_at ....................... datetime  
```

We need to add a `dek_salt` column to this table (`varchar`).

```
  Column ............................... Type  
  id, autoincrement ................. integer  
  email ............................. varchar  
  email_verified_at, nullable ...... datetime  
  password .......................... varchar  
  remember_token, nullable .......... varchar  
  dek_salt .......................... varchar
  created_at ....................... datetime  
```

When a user registers, our client-side app generates both a DEK and a salt. We then send the email and password as well as the dek_salt (a base64 string) to the backend. Providing a `dek_salt` at registration is now mandatory: omitting it will trigger a validation error.

When the user logs in later, we keep the clear-text password of the user in memory for a very short time (in our JS framework), and we use the salt returned by the backend (on authentication success) to generate the DEK again. We transform the base64 salt into a `Uint8Array` and use it to generate the DEK back.

```typescript
// on login success
const saltString: Base64String = response.data.dek_salt;
const salt: Uint8Array = base64ToUint8Array(saltString);

const dek: CryptoKey = await generateDek(
    userPassword,
    salt
);
```

## What about the DEK?

The DEK we have is a `CryptoKey` object. It can be stored in memory, if you have a Single-Page Application. The question is: what happens if the user refreshes the page or closes the tab? We then lose the DEK. We don't have any way (for now) to avoid sending the user to the login page again. Let's see how to fix this. This will be useful for page refreshes, but also if the user wants to stay connected to the site with a "Remember me" option.

### Storing the DEK

Since the backend must know nothing from the DEK, using cookies is not an option. The obvious idea coming to mind is to use `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`. This is quite simple.

<InsertBox>

It would probably be more secure to use `sessionStorage` (since the data is deleted when the tab is closed) but we want to keep the DEK even if the user closes the tab (our user will use a _remember me_token). We will then use `localStorage`.

Obviously, when a user logs out, it's important to delete all the user's data from `localStorage`.

</InsertBox>

Since localStorage can only store strings, we have to convert the `CryptoKey` object to a string. We first have to export it to a raw `Uint8Array`, then convert it to a base64 string. We already have our function to convert a `Uint8Array` to base64.

Unfortunately the exportKey method doesn't return a `Uint8Array`, but an `ArrayBuffer`. We can easily convert it to a `Uint8Array` though.

<InsertBox>

To be honest, I still have trouble understanding the exact relation between `Uint8Array` and `ArrayBuffer`. I guess we don't need to dive into this for what we're doing here. You can read about `ArrayBuffer` [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer).

</InsertBox>

```typescript
async function cryptoKeyToBase64(key: CryptoKey): Promise<Base64String> {
  const rawKey: ArrayBuffer = await crypto.subtle.exportKey('raw', key);

  return uint8ArrayToBase64(new Uint8Array(rawKey));
}
```

This simple function gives us a base64 string from a `CryptoKey` object. We can now store it in `localStorage` very easily:

```typescript
// 'WGObg9QpgtfaJ3Dk9hg1x2tnHq/kKQnLfUxvW7SS5vA='
const dekBase64: Base64String = await cryptoKeyToBase64(dek);

localStorage.setItem('dek', dekBase64);
```

Every time we generate the DEK, we keep the `CryptoKey` object in memory in our JS framework, and we also store its base64 representation in `localStorage`. This way, if the user refreshes the page, we retrieve the string representation of the DEK from `localStorage` and import it back as a `CryptoKey` object.

We will create a function to create a `CryptoKey` object from a `Uint8Array` and another being just a simple wrapper to convert a base64 string to a `CryptoKey` object. It gives us more flexibility and we could need it later.

```typescript
async function uint8ArrayToCryptoKey(
  keyString: Uint8Array,
  exportable: boolean = true,
): Promise<CryptoKey> {
  return await crypto.subtle.importKey(
    'raw',
    keyString,
    { name: 'AES-GCM' },
    // We make this a parameter of our function because
    // it will be useful later
    exportable,
    ['encrypt', 'decrypt'],
  );
}

async function base64ToCryptoKey(
  keyString: Base64String,
  exportable: boolean = true,
): Promise<CryptoKey> {
  const raw: Uint8Array = base64ToUint8Array(keyString);

  return await uint8ArrayToCryptoKey(raw, exportable);
}
```

Then, to generate the CryptoKey object from the base64 string we stored in localStorage:

```typescript
const dekBase64: Base64String = localStorage.getItem('dek');

if (dekBase64) {
  const dek: CryptoKey = await base64ToCryptoKey(dekBase64);
} else {
    // We logout the user and redirect them to the login page
}
```

<InsertBox>

`exportKey` also allows to export keys in the JWK format. This format is a JSON object dedicated to storing cryptographic keys. It is a standard format, especially useful to store a pair of public and private keys. You can read more about JWK [here](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517).

In our case, we only have a simple symmetric key, so I don't think it adds any value to use JWK compared to base64 (please correct me if I'm wrong).

</InsertBox>

We will see later if there is a better way to store the DEK. For now, serializing it to base64 and storing it in `localStorage` does the job.

## Encrypting and Decrypting Data

We can finally encrypt and decrypt data. Instead of storing the `amount` value as an integer in our database we will now store an `encrypted_amount` as a string.

The `consumptions` table as we described it before:

```
  Column ............................... Type  
  id, autoincrement ................. integer  
  user_id ........................... integer  
  day .................................. date  
  amount ............................ integer  

  Foreign Key .......................
  user_id references id on users ....
```

Now:

```
  Column ............................... Type  
  id, autoincrement ................. integer  
  user_id ........................... integer  
  day .................................. date  
  encrypted_amount .................. varchar  

  Foreign Key .......................
  user_id references id on users ....
```

I first thought it would be a problem to encrypt the `amount` alone as it would result in the same encrypted data for the same input value. Even if we can't decrypt the value itself, seeing that every Saturday there is the same encrypted value that is different from the ones seen on other days during the week could give some information about the drinking habits of the users. It would be easy to deduce that the user drinks the same amount every Saturday (and if the data is not the one seen during the week, we could probably infer that our user drinks more on weekends).

So my first thought was that instead of encrypting the `amount` alone we could encrypt an object containing the `amount` and the `day`. Something like this:

```typescript
// Even if the amount is the same
// the encrypted data changes every day
const data = {
  amount: 3,
  day: '2025-01-09',
};

async function encryptData(
    key: CryptoKey,
    data: Object
): Promise<Base64String> {
    // ...
}
```

This was before I knew how the `crypto` API works. When we encrypt and decrypt data with AES-GCM, we must provide an **IV** (_Initialization Vector_).

<InsertBox>

**Think of an IV as similar to a salt but used for encryption/decryption.** A salt makes it possible that the same password gives a different hash. An IV has the same role when it comes to encrypted data. The same input data will give a different encrypted data if the IV is different. You then need to give the same IV to decrypt the data.

**We therefore need to generate a new random IV every time we encrypt data, and store it alongside the encrypted data.** We will store the IV as a base64 string.

</InsertBox>

Since we will use a random IV every time we encrypt `amount`, the output will always be different and won't give us hints about the input.

Let's add the IV to our `consumptions` table:

```
  Column ............................... Type  
  id, autoincrement ................. integer  
  user_id ........................... integer  
  day .................................. date  
  encrypted_amount .................. varchar  
  iv ................................ varchar  

  Foreign Key .......................
  user_id references id on users ....
```

We first create a function to generate our IV:

```typescript
function generateIv(): Uint8Array {
  // This is 12 bytes long (96 bits)
  return generateRandomKey(12);
}
```

<InsertBox>

We follow the recommendation found in the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AesGcmParams):

> The AES-GCM specification recommends that the IV should be 96 bits long.

> Note that the IV does not have to be secret, just unique: so it is OK, for example, to transmit it in the clear alongside the encrypted message.

</InsertBox>

We can then encrypt data:

```typescript
type EncryptionResult = {
  iv: Base64String;
  encryptedData: Base64String;
};

async function encryptData(
  key: CryptoKey,
  data: any,
): Promise<EncryptionResult> {
  // Everytime we encrypt something we
  // use a new random IV
  const iv: Uint8Array = generateIv();

  // In our case, the data is an integer but we make this
  // implementation generic so that we can encrypt anything
  const serializedData = JSON.stringify(data);

  const encryptedData: ArrayBuffer = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
    { name: 'AES-GCM', iv },
    key,
    new TextEncoder().encode(serializedData),
  );

  return {
    // We return the iv as base64 string
    iv: uint8ArrayToBase64(iv),
    // We return the encryptedData as base64 string
    encryptedData: uint8ArrayToBase64(new Uint8Array(encryptedData)),
  };
}
```

And we can store the `iv` and the `encryptedData` in the database.

```typescript
/*
{
    iv: "+c1Ubll95bP0Vk7S",
    encryptedData: "h/LAb9bgsfPVuWm0NlIgMp8="
}
*/
const { iv, encryptedData } = await encryptData(dek, 3);
```

<InsertBox>

I've noticed after some tests that with a 12 bytes-long IV and an amount between 0 and 5, the encrypted amount (once serialized as base64) is always 24 characters long.

And the IV is always 16 characters long (serialized).

So on the backend, I validate the `encrypted_amount` and the `iv` to make sure they have this exact length.

**Since data is encrypted I cannot validate the input on the server. This means if I store `encrypted_amount` as a longtext, some smart users could use my app as some storage for files or something else. Always restrict the length of the encrypted data.**

Users will be able to bypass client-side validation and break their app (hey, it's their choice) but they won't be able to store crazy things.

</InsertBox>

When the user goes to a new page, we retrieve the `iv` and the `encryptedData` from the backend and we decrypt data to show it to the user:

```typescript
async function decryptData(
  key: CryptoKey,
  iv: Base64String,
  encryptedData: Base64String,
): Promise<any> {
  const decryptedData: ArrayBuffer = await crypto.subtle.decrypt(
    { name: 'AES-GCM', iv: base64ToUint8Array(iv) },
    key,
    base64ToUint8Array(encryptedData),
  );

  const decoded: string = new TextDecoder().decode(decryptedData);

  return JSON.parse(decoded);
}

// 3
const decryptedData = await decryptData(dek, iv, encryptedData);
```

Success! We now have a functional implementation of end-to-end encryption.

If you're curious about performance, I checked the time it takes to encrypt and decrypt data. On my computer, encrypting an amount takes 0.06ms on average. Decrypting it is even faster: 0.03ms on average.

[Here you can find a gist](https://gist.github.com/Einenlum/ccb4b167651a5f5954914fb810475f5e) of the code we have implemented so far.

While our current implementation works, it still has flaws. In the [next article](/articles/e2ee-for-web-apps-3) we will learn about **KEK** (Key Encryption Key) and how it could improve our workflow.
