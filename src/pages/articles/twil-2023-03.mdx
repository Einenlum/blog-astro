## PXP - PHP

[PXP](https://pxplang.org/introduction/what-is-pxp.html) is a superset on top of PHP, built in Rust. You can feel the inspiration of Typescript and Rust (Generics and Type aliases) or from Python (operator overloading). At a very early stage right now, but I will keep an eye on it.

## Lua

Lua doesn't have regexes, because the C regex engine is bigger than the whole Lua interpreter itself. Lua has a simpler alternative to regexes called [patterns](https://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html).

## Javascript

For a long time, doing a deep copy in Javascript required external libraries. It seems like now it's possible natively.

```javascript
const someObj = {
  a: 1,
  b: ['an', 'array'],
  c: {
    d: 2,
  },
};

// introduction of the new structuredClone function
const someObj2 = structuredClone(someObj);

someObj.b.push('of', 'strings');

console.log(someObj.b); // ["an", "array", "of", "strings"]
console.log(someObj2.b); // ["an", "array"]
```

Available since Node 17.0, Chrome 98 and Firefox 94.

## Cryptography

[Picocrypt](https://github.com/HACKERALERT/Picocrypt) is a small tool written in Go to encrypt and decrypt files, focused on simplicity and security. It is open source (on the contrary to BitLocker) and a security audit is planned.

## Git

[git-sim](https://initialcommit.com/blog/git-sim) is a Python tool to simulate visually what will happen if you launch a git command.

Looks really interesting but the installation (with manim) seems quite cumbersome, unfortunately.
