## Crul

[Crul](https://www.crul.com/) is a product allowing you to easily crawl websites and manipulate the extracted data. Didn't try it but it seems like a paying product (free for now?) available on Mac OS and Docker.

Will keep an eye on it cause I like the idea and the syntax.

## Pyston

In [this discussion](https://discuss.python.org/t/contributing-the-pyston-jit/24195/8) where a contributor of Pyston suggests integrating their JIT to CPython, I discovered the existence of [Pyston](https://www.pyston.org/) itself.

It focuses on the simplicity of use (it should be really easy to replace CPython with Pyston) to easily drastically improve performance, and it even provides a _lite_ version that doesn't replace CPython but adds a dependency through `pip` or `conda`.

## HackerFM

[HackerFM](https://hacker.fm/) is a daily podcast talking about tech. Its particularity? It's written and hosted by an AI. Some episodes talk about AI itself.

I guess the future is now (and creepy).

## Learn Prompting

[Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.com/) is a free website teaching you how to write better prompts when interacting with an AI (whether it's ChatGPT or an illustration AI like MidJourney).
