## Neovim - Lua

Since I changed my vim config to use lua almost everywhere I didn't understand why I kept having a folder called `~` created in many working folders.
Apart from being super dangerous (no, I didn't try to remove it with `rm -Rf ~` fortunately **\[PLEASEDONTDOTHAT\]**. I was happy to use my GUI for this), it was super weird.

I realized it's because of this option in one of my lua config files:

```lua
vim.opt.backupdir = "~/.config/nvim/backup"
```

It was creating a whole `./~/.config/nvim/backup` in my current directory.

What worked before with VimScript dosn't work with lua anymore (the `~` folder is not transformed into my HOME directory).

You have to use this instead:

```lua
vim.opt.backupdir = os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.config/nvim/backup"
```

Found [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/15777).

## Typescript

I learned this week the existence of the `Readonly` keyword in typescript.
In Typescript (and Javascript), the `const` keyword only implies you cannot set another value to the same variable name.

```typescript
const my_val = 2;
// Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'my_val'.(2451)
const my_val = 3;
```

But if the value itself is mutable, declaring it as `const` still allows you to mutate it.

```typescript
const my_val = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

// This is okay
my_val.push('d');
```

If you want to make it immutable, you can use the `Readonly` utility type.

```typescript
const my_val: Readonly<string[]> = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

// Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.(2339)
my_val.push('d');
```

It's nice, but Typescript still won't treat your variable as a constant:

```typescript
const my_val: Readonly<string[]> = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

// const letter: string
const letter = my_val[1];
```

If you want to do so, you can use `as const`:

```typescript
const my_val = ['a', 'b', 'c'] as const;

// const letter: 'c'
const letter = my_val[1];
```

And the mutation is still not possible.

Typescript also has multiple very interesting utility types. Documentation [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html).

Since version 4.9, Typescript also has a new `satisfies` operator, which allows to typehint a variable (and checks it's valid) while still know about its values. You can check [this well written article](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9/#the-satisfies-operator) explaining it.

## Python - Linter

It seems like Rust starts to become the new standard for fast tools.
[Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) is the new kid on the block when it comes to Python linters. Didn't try it yet, but the benchmarks are astonishing.
