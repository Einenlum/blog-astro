## Ara

I talked [last week](/twil-2023-03) about [PXP](https://pxplang.org/introduction/what-is-pxp.html), a PHP Superset written in Rust. It seems another competitor is [Ara](https://ara-lang.io/introduction/what-is-ara.html). Also written in Rust, also a Superset. It seems less advanced, but I will also keep an eye on it.

## PHP

I didn't catch this information but, in PHP 7.4, [appeared an underscore numeric separator](https://php.watch/versions/7.4/underscore_numeric_separator).

This means these lines of code are equivalent (the same feature already existed in Python):

```php
$a = 1_234_567;
$b = 1234567;

$a === $b; // true
```

## CSS

I discovered the `:is` pseudo-class in CSS. Quite convenient.

These are equivalent:

```css
is(.cls-1, .cls-2, .cls-3) p {
  color: teal;
}

.cls-1 p,
.cls-2 p,
.cls-3 p {
  color: teal;
}
```

Found [here](https://www.builder.io/blog/css-is).

## Astro

Astro 2.0 [is out](https://astro.build/blog/astro-2/). It introduces [type safety for Markdown and MDX files](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-content-collections/), which sounds quite exciting. I have not migrated this blog to the new version yet, but I will do it soon.

## Kodezi

I discovered [Kodezi](https://kodezi.com/), an AI tool acting like Grammarly but for code. It can explain what your code does, translate it into another language, and optimize it. Didn't try it yet. It has a personal Web IDE or a VS Code extension.
