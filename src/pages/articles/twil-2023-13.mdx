## Python - Pyvibe

[Pyvibe](https://www.pyvibe.com/) allows to create web components just from Python code. It seems super easy to use.

For now only a default theme is supported but there should be more soon.

## JSON - HJSON and JSON5

[JSON5](https://json5.org/) is a language that can be compiled to JSON and allows for a more human readable/editable syntax (comments, trailing commas…). It has been adopted by Chromium or NextJS, and has 6k stars on GitHub.

[HJSON](https://hjson.github.io/) (for Human JSON) is another project in the same style but it seems less known (2.5k stars on GitHub).

## Neovim - Impatient

[Impatient](https://github.com/lewis6991/impatient.nvim) is a Neovim plugin improving the start-up time. But… since my Vim start-up is almost instant (despite aaaall my plugins), I don't really understand the advantage.

The benchmark in the README was quite funny.

Before: _54.337ms_. After: _6.357ms_.

The difference is impressive (in terms of magnitude) but… Well. I tried it, and (surprisingly) I did not see any difference. But if you have 200 hundred more plugins than I have, maybe it could be useful to you.
