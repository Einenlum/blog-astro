I wrote about it [here](/articles/goodbye-nextjs-hello-astro/), my blog is generated through Astro. I love it because I can build my blog using components and Tailwind, and still have no JS served to my readers.

I wrote a few TWIL (This Week I Learned) articles, and I sometimes wonder if it's worth it for people. I probably don't describe enough what the article talks about and it's hard to find a specific article talking about some topic.

It's been a few months since I have been thinking about adding a search feature to my blog, but I never took the time to do it. My blog is generated statically and served on Vercel, so adding a search feature is not that simple. You either need to use a third party like Algolia, or to use a package you provide yourself after having built the index.

I stumbled upon [this article](https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2023/02/10/adding-search-to-a-static-blog/) from Chris Hartjes, who had the same goal and it allowed me to add a working search feature to this blog in just a couple hours. Shout out to him!

I struggled a bit with how implement this with Astro and Tailwind so this blog post shows step by step my journey, hoping it can be useful to someone.

## Pagefind

The open-source tool we will use here is called [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/). Written to be super fast and efficient, it allows (according to its author) to quickly build an index and search through tens of thousands of pages in the browser. [Here is a very well-made presentation from the author](https://pagefind.app/) I recommend you to check out.

## Installation

```
yarn add pagefind
```

We will first build the astro static website (since Pagefind operates on the HTML generated files):

```
npm run build
```

And we can then run Pagefind to build our index, specifying our `dist` folder (the one that astro creates for the static files):

```
npx pagefind --source dist
```

And _voila_! We have a an index built automatically in `dist/_pagefind`. How easier could this be?

Pagefind can read a `pagefind.yml` file to avoid passing arguments to the CLI. I created one in my root folder:

```yaml
# pagefind.yml
source: dist
bundle_dir: _pagefind
```

If you want Pagefind to spaw a webserver with your static files for you to do some tests, you can use the `--serve` flag.

```
npx pagefind --source dist --serve
```

I also decided to add Pagefind to my `build` command inside my `package.json` so that every time Vercel builds the website it also generates the index.

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "build": "astro build && pagefind"
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

Now every time I run `npm run build` my index is automatically generated.

Pagefind provides an already-made UI with a form on their website. We first need to load its JS and CSS files. Since I only wanted to add these to my page search, I added a prop to my layout to know if I should include these files are not. It's probably not the best way to achieve this, but hey, I'm not an expert.

```astro
---
// src/layouts/layout.astro

import Header from '../components/header.astro';
import FeedLink from '../components/feed-link.astro';
import '../styles/global.css';

export interface Props {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  // should we include search links?
  includeSearch?: boolean;
}

const { title, description, includeSearch } = Astro.props as Props;
---

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.png" />
    <!-- here we include them if needed -->
    {
      includeSearch && (
        <>
          <link href="/_pagefind/pagefind-ui.css" rel="stylesheet" />
          <script src="/_pagefind/pagefind-ui.js" type="text/javascript" />
        </>
      )
    }

    <!-- ... ->
	</head>
	<body class="dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:text-amber-50">
		<!-- ... ->
	</body>
</html>
--></head
  >
</html>
```

Then on my search page:

```astro
---
import Layout from '../layouts/layout.astro';
import PageTitle from '../components/page-title.astro';
---

<Layout
  title="Einenlum - Search"
  description="Search for articles."
  includeSearch={true}
>
  <div class="mb-8">
    <PageTitle>Search for articles</PageTitle>
  </div>

  <div id="search"></div>
  <script>
    window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
      new PagefindUI({ element: '#search' });
    });
  </script>
</Layout>
```

We already have a working search. Incredible!

## Customizing the appearance

I didn't want images to appear in the result list. So I added this to my JS on my search page:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
  new PagefindUI({ element: '#search', showImages: false });
});
```

The most complicated part for me was to understand how to customize the theme. I first needed to find the classes I needed to change. I checked the web inspector to know which ones were used.

The problem I had was that I wanted to apply Tailwind classes to them because I didn't want to use hexadecimal codes for colors instead of the Tailwind classes I used elsewhere. This would bring some confusion.

I needed a custom CSS file that was parsed by Tailwind. To do so, I first needed to disable Tailwind global styling (to be able to use a custom Tailwind CSS file).

In my `astro.config.mjs` file, I added the following to my Tailwind integration:

```javascript
// ...
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    tailwind({
      applyBaseStyles: false,
    }),
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
});
```

I then added a `src/styles/global.css` file

```css
/* src/styles/global.css */

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* The word that is looked for and highlighted in the results */
.pagefind-ui--reset mark,
mark {
  @apply bg-indigo-200 !important;
}

.pagefind-ui__result-tag {
  @apply text-black;
}

.pagefind-ui__result,
.pagefind-ui__result-title,
.pagefind-ui__result-link {
  @apply dark:text-amber-50 !important;
}

.pagefind-ui__message {
  @apply text-black dark:text-amber-50 !important;
  @apply font-normal !important;
}

.pagefind-ui__result-link {
  @apply text-pink-900 !important;
  @apply hover:text-pink-700 !important;
  @apply dark:text-indigo-200 !important;
  @apply transition !important;
  @apply ease-in-out !important;
  @apply delay-150 !important;
  text-decoration: none !important;
}

.pagefind-ui__search-input {
  @apply border border-pink-900 dark:border-indigo-200 !important;
  @apply font-normal !important;
  @apply font-sans !important;
}

.pagefind-ui__search-input:focus,
.pagefind-ui__search-input:active,
.pagefind-ui__search-input:focus-visible {
  outline: unset !important;
}
```

And added this line to my `src/layouts/layout.astro` file.

```javascript
import '../styles/global.css';
```

This way I was able to use the @apply directive from Tailwind, which is very handy. I also added `!important` tags since Pagefind CSS declarations are quite precise and could sometimes override mine.

It finally matched my theme.

## The last tweaks

Pagefind by default takes the first `h1` tag on every page to show them as the title in the result list. Every page of mine had my name (Einenlum) as an `h1` in my Layout, which caused every result to have my name as the title. I changed it to a `div` (which is probably better for my SEO performance anyway - the title of my article should be the only `h1` on the page).

I needed another tweak to make only my articles referenced in the index. To do so, you can add the `data-pagefind-body` attribute to some elements. If only one is present in the project, then Pagefind will discard every HTML part that doesn't have this attribute.

I added it to my `src/layouts/article-layout.astro` file.

```astro
---
import ArticleHeader from '../components/article-header.astro';
import Layout from './layout.astro';

export interface Props {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  publishedAt: Date;
}

const { title, description, publishedAt } = Astro.props;
---

<Layout title={title} description={description}>
  <!-- Pagefind will only look for articles now -->
  <div data-pagefind-body>
    <ArticleHeader title={title} publishedAt={publishedAt} />

    <slot />
  </div>
</Layout>
```

Now only my articles are present in the index.

Another thing is that I wanted Pagefind to show the publication date of an article in the result. To do that you can use the `data-pagefind-meta` attribute, set to `"date"`, on an HTML tag containing your date.

I added this to my `src/components/article-header.astro` file.

```astro
---
interface Props {
  publishedAt: Date;
  title: string;
}

const { publishedAt, title } = Astro.props as Props;
---

<div class="...">
  <h1 class="...">{title}</h1>
  <p class="..." data-pagefind-meta="date">{publishedAt.toDateString()}</p>
</div>
```

Now the date appears in the result automatically. Magical.

## Conclusion

I thought adding a client-side search to a static website would be way more complicated than that. The performance is amazing and I don't have to worry about my index anymore. Every new article will be added automatically to the index and be searchable.

Thanks Pagefind!
