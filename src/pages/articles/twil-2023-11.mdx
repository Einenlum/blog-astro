## Python

[This article](https://tushar.lol/post/cursed-for/) shows how someone tried to implement a `for` loop in _c style_ in Python. It's obviously a bad idea, but Tushar is definitely super creative. A really interesting read.

## Vim

I wondered how to sort alphabetically lines in vim. Turns out it's super simple. Just select the lines you want to sort, and then type `:sort`. That's it. If you want to sort in reverse order, just type `:sort!`.

## PHP

After 10 years of PHP I realized you can actually increment a string.

```php
$input = 'aa';
$input++; // 'ab'

$input = 'zz';
$input++; // 'aaa'

$input = 'string001';
$input++; // 'string002'

$input = 'string999';
$input++; // 'strinh000'
```
