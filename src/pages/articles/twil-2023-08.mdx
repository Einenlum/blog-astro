## HTML - Encryption

[Staticrypt](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt) is a tool that allows you to encrypt HTML files using a password. You can protect some static content on a server like Github pages, Netlfiy or Vercel.

## Postgres - Psql

[Psql Tips](https://psql-tips.org) is a website showing random tips for `psql` (the Postgres CLI).

## PHP - Security Bug

This [PHP bug](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=81744) is really surprising. It seems like for some hashes, if it is invalid, the `password_verify` function returns `true`. The conversation is quite surreal. Probably one of the most incredible "not a bug, it's a feature" I've ever seen.

One could argue it's not such a big deal, since if an attacker has access to the database, you have bigger issues. However, as someone noted on Hacker News, it's not the most probable scenario. If a migration corrupts the database data and in particular some password hashes, it's possible that some users can log in with any password. Aoutch.

## VS Code - Code server

[Code Server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) is a tool that allows to run VS Code is the browser, while it's running on a remote server. It allows to compute everything in the cloud, which makes it possibly lighter for an old laptop.

## Civet - Javascript - Typescript

[Civet](https://civet.dev/) is a superset that compiles into Typescript or Javascript (Who's gonna stop the progress?). It adds some syntactic sugar, mostly taken from Rust or Python.

I particularly like: pattern matching, everything is an expression, string dedent and more flexible spreading.
