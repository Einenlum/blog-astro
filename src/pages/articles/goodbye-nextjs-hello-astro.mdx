## JS: a hate story

Frontend had never been my thing. I had always been more attracted to backend stuff: dealing with some serialization processes and a few data types had always been way more relaxing and interesting to me than dealing with the DOM.

When I started my first job as a web developer in an agency (surrounded by very clever minds) I didn't know JS. And I felt already that everything was moving way too fast.

I should probably write about it someday, but I clearly developed a fear of Javascript all these years (CSS was not a great story either).

Recently when I decided to create this blog, I wanted to overcome my fear of JS and CSS. NextJS was a nice discovery (Thanks [Olivier](https://devblog.dunsap.com/)!). I had already worked with React a bit, but having a framework organizing everything was quite reassuring. When I also added TailwindCSS, I even started to have fun.

The speed of development was quite crazy. I still had a few things to care about, like creating the RSS feed, finding a way to fetch all my articles to build the homepage… But overall, it was a surprisingly pleasant experience.

**I then moved the blog to Typescript which was again a surprisingly positive discovery.**

The only thing that was bothering me was the size of the website. My blog was just static pages and the fact that the homepage was already a few hundred kilobytes made no sense.

Why send all this JS to the wire for a website that has no interactivity?

Thanks to the [Fireship youtube channel,](https://fireship.io/) I discovered [Astro.](https://astro.build/) It felt like it was exactly what I needed. The idea of the possibility of not sending JS was just so appealing!

## To the stars!

Moving from NextJS to Astro was really easy. I decided I would not use React anymore since my needs were quite basic and the astro template system was perfect for me. I enjoyed the separation between the rendered part and the data fetching part.

I needed to change the name of my files (from `.tsx` to `.astro`), to add the suffix in import statements (`import ... from 'my-component.astro'`), to remove all these verbose `export const MyElement = () {}` and change all the `className` to `class` (YES!).

Before:

```tsx
import ALink from './a-link';

function getLicense(license: string | undefined): string {
  if (!license) {
    return '';
  }

  return '(license ' + license + ')';
}

interface Props {
  author: string;
  imageName: string;
  license?: string;
  source: string;
}

export default function ImageSource({
  author,
  imageName,
  license,
  source,
}: Props) {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-sm mx-auto text-sm lg:text-base">
      {imageName ? (
        <p className="text-center mx-auto">
          <span className="italic">
            <ALink href={source}>{imageName}</ALink>
          </span>{' '}
          by {author} {getLicense(license)}
        </p>
      ) : (
        <p className="mx-auto text-center">
          Image by <ALink href={source}>{author}</ALink> {getLicense(license)}
        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

After:

```astro
---
import ALink from './a-link.astro';

function getLicense(license: string | undefined): string {
  if (!license) {
    return '';
  }

  return '(license ' + license + ')';
}

interface Props {
  author: string;
  imageName: string;
  license?: string;
  source: string;
}

const { author, imageName, license, source } = Astro.props as Props;
---

<div class="max-w-sm mx-auto text-sm lg:text-base">
  {
    imageName ? (
      <p class="text-center mx-auto">
        <span class="italic">
          <ALink href={source}>{imageName}</ALink>
        </span>{' '}
        by {author} {getLicense(license)}
      </p>
    ) : (
      <p class="mx-auto text-center">
        Image by <ALink href={source}>{author}</ALink> {getLicense(license)}
      </p>
    )
  }
</div>
```

Very similar.

A greaaaaaaaat thing with Astro is the automatic syntax highlighting (happening on the server, not in the client). Damn, it made my life so much easier. It was quite a nightmare to make it work with NextJS (more on Astro and syntax highlighting [in their docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#syntax-highlighting)).

Another nice surprise is the `Astro.glob` function that gives you a list of your files, including some exported variables and their path automatically.

```js
const posts = await Astro.glob('./articles/*.mdx');
```

I also particularly enjoyed how easy it was to generate a full RSS feed. Damn. It was way more complicated with NextJS.

Here is the only thing needed, stored in `/src/pages/rss.xml.js` (I used JS here instead of typescript because I didn't want to bother with all the types ^^):

```js
import rss from '@astrojs/rss';

const articleImportResult = import.meta.glob('./articles/*.mdx', {
  eager: true,
});
const articles = Object.values(articleImportResult);
const recentArticles = articles.sort((a, b) => b.publishedAt - a.publishedAt);

export const get = () =>
  rss({
    title: 'Einenlum',
    description: "Einenlum's blog",
    site: import.meta.env.SITE,
    items: recentArticles.map((article) => ({
      title: article.title,
      description: article.description,
      link: article.url,
      pubDate: article.publishedAt,
    })),
    customData: `<language>en-us</language>`,
  });
```

And that's all! More about RSS [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss/).

One thing I regret a bit though is that you have to define your markdown equivalent components in every `.mdx` file instead of doing it in one place. Example:

```tsx
import H1 from '../components/h1.astro';
import H2 from '../components/h2.astro';

export const components = {
  h1: H1,
  h2: H2,
};
```

The exported `components` variable holds the mapping between the markdown tags and the components to use. But it's not such a big deal if you just import this mapping from somewhere else and assign it to the local components variable in every mdx file.

More about the MDX integration [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/).

## Benchmark

Here is how what the main page loaded with NextJS:

Here is the global size:

_Pardon my French… system (pun intended)._

We can see we had 11 requests for a total of 307 kilobytes.

Here is the main page today with Astro:

And the global size:

We now have only 4 requests (no Javascript!) and only 50 kilobytes.

Some articles were quite heavy before, because I needed to create the syntax highlighting on the client side. For [this article](https://www.einenlum.com/articles/docker-compose-circle-ci), there were a lot of files and bytes involved:

![A capture of Firefox developer tools on the network tab, showing the list of downloaded files](https://res.cloudinary.com/dybam16gk/image/upload/v1668466065/blog_images/before-ci-files_irsmrb.png)

12 requests and 1.36 Megabyte just for an article with some codeblocks was really excessive…

Here is how it looks like now:

![A capture of Firefox developer tools on the network tab, showing the list of downloaded files](https://res.cloudinary.com/dybam16gk/image/upload/v1668466194/blog_images/after-ci-files_qk9ukt.png)

3 requests and **50 kilobytes**!

This page's size was divided by **21**.

Now, I probably didn't configure NextJS the best way, I admit. But you can't beat a page without JS in terms of file size and browser being quickly responsive.

Using Astro was so pleasant.

I didn't have to use [Astro islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) yet because all my website needs no JS. I'll be curious to try this out if needed.

Till now, I'm happy.
