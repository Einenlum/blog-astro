<!--
Had to add overflow-x-auto and whitespace-pre-wrap because there
seems to be a bug with mdx and wrap. Even though I set the "wrap" option to true in astro.config.mjs,
it keeps breaking my layout.
See this issue: https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/4345

<pre class="overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base bg-[#2e3440] text-white p-1 sm:p-4 rounded-sm mb-4"><slot /></pre>
